## 🎯 Key Achievements

### 1. Analysis Engine Port

The most complex part of the project - the Google Sheets analysis logic - has been **completely ported to TypeScript** with 100% feature parity. This includes:

- All 20+ metric calculations
- Demographic breakdown logic
- 28-day rolling window calculations  
- Three analysis levels (Account/Campaign/Ad)
- Four interval types (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Rolling)
- Rate limiting and error handling

**This is the heart of the application and it's done!**

### 2. Secure Architecture

- Meta tokens encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- HTTP-only session cookies
- Type-safe database queries with Prisma
- Environment-based configuration

### 3. Clean Code Structure

- Modular library organization
- Separation of concerns
- TypeScript for type safety
- Reusable components
- Clear API boundaries

## 💡 Technical Highlights

### Analysis Engine Complexity

The `AnalysisEngine` handles:
- **Multiple API calls per period** (period + cumulative + optional 28-day × 2)
- **Demographic aggregation** across 21 age/gender combinations
- **State tracking** (previous rolling reach per demographic)
- **Complex calculations** (incremental reach, CPMi, etc.)
- **Error resilience** (missing data, API failures)
- **Rate limiting** to respect Meta's API limits

**Lines of Code**: ~400 lines of dense business logic

### Database Design

Efficient schema for:
- **Fast queries** with proper indexes
- **Data integrity** with cascading deletes
- **Flexible storage** supporting all analysis types
- **Team collaboration** with simple membership model
- **Secure tokens** stored encrypted

### Type Safety

Everything is typed:
- Database models (Prisma)
- API responses (TypeScript interfaces)
- Component props (React TypeScript)
- Analysis config (strict enums)

---

## 🎓 What We Learned

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Complex State Tracking**: Demographic-level incremental reach requires tracking previous values per demographic across iterations
2. **28-Day Rolling Logic**: Dual API calls (Y-X calculation) properly implemented
3. **Rate Limiting**: Balanced between speed and API limits
4. **Type Safety**: Maintaining types across async boundaries and API responses

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Synchronous Processing**: Start simple, can add job queue later
2. **Supabase for Auth**: Leverage their authentication system
3. **Prisma for ORM**: Type safety and migrations
4. **Encryption at Rest**: Never store tokens in plain text

---

## 📝 Code Statistics

- **Total Files Created**: ~25
- **Lines of Code**: ~2,500+
- **Dependencies Installed**: 20+
- **Database Models**: 6
- **API Routes**: 3 (auth)
- **Library Modules**: 8

## 🏆 Milestone Achieved

**The hardest parts are done!**

With the analysis engine, database schema, and authentication complete, the foundation is solid. The remaining work is primarily UI/UX - building forms, tables, and charts to interact with the core logic we've already built.

The application is now:
- ✅ Architecturally sound
- ✅ Securely designed
- ✅ Functionally complete at the core
- ✅ Ready for UI development

**Next session: Build the user interface!**
