## üéØ Key Achievements

### 1. Demographic Breakdowns ‚úÖ
**What it does**: Every metric is now broken down by age and gender combinations

**Implementation**:
- Added `breakdowns: ['age', 'gender']` to all API calls
- Parses API responses into demographic buckets
- Generates one "TOTAL" row + individual demographic rows per time period
- Supports 21 demographic combinations (7 age ranges √ó 3 genders)

**Demographics Tracked**:
```
13-17: male, female, unknown
18-24: male, female, unknown
25-34: male, female, unknown
35-44: male, female, unknown
45-54: male, female, unknown
55-64: male, female, unknown
65+:   male, female, unknown
```

**Impact**: Marketers can now identify which age/gender segments are most efficiently reached and convert best

---

### 2. Ad-Level Analysis ‚úÖ
**What it does**: Analyze individual ad performance with full demographic breakdowns

**Implementation**:
- New `performAdLevelAnalysis()` function
- Fetches all ads with spend via `{entity_id}/ads` endpoint
- Can analyze all ads in account OR all ads in specific campaign
- Processes each ad with same demographic logic as account/campaign
- Outputs to dedicated `DATA_Ad_Output` sheet

**Use Cases**:
- Identify top-performing ad creative by demographic
- Find ads that efficiently reach specific age/gender groups
- Analyze creative patterns that resonate with target audiences
- Test multiple creative approaches and compare results

**Impact**: Creative-level optimization becomes data-driven

---

### 3. 28-Day Rolling Metrics ‚úÖ
**What it does**: Tracks reach growth with a floating 28-day lookback window

**Implementation**:
- New analysis type: "Daily with 28-Day Rolling"
- Dual API call methodology:
  - **Y**: Total reach from (Date - 27 days) to Date
  - **X**: Total reach from (Date - 27 days) to (Date - 1)
  - **28-Day Incremental**: Y - X
- Calculated for both aggregated totals and each demographic
- Three additional columns added to output

**New Metrics**:
- **28-Day Rolling Reach**: Total unique users in past 28 days
- **28-Day Rolling Incremental Reach**: New users reached "today" vs. previous 27 days
- **28-Day CPMi**: Cost per 1000 incremental users over rolling window

**Impact**: Identifies audience saturation and creative fatigue in real-time

---

### 4. Conversion & Revenue Tracking ‚úÖ
**What it does**: Monitors purchase conversions, attributed revenue, CPA, and ROAS

**Implementation**:
- Added `actions` and `action_values` to API field requests
- Parses `offsite_conversion.fb_pixel_purchase` events
- Calculates per-demographic conversions and revenue
- New calculated metrics: Period CPA, Period ROAS

**New Metrics**:
- **Period Conversions**: Total purchase conversions in period
- **Period Revenue**: Total attributed revenue in period
- **Period CPA**: Cost per acquisition (Spend / Conversions)
- **Period ROAS**: Return on ad spend (Revenue / Spend)

**All tracked by demographic** - see which age/gender groups have best ROAS

**Impact**: Connect reach optimization with bottom-line performance

---

### 5. Multi-Level Execution ‚úÖ
**What it does**: Run Account, Campaign, and/or Ad analyses simultaneously

**Implementation**:
- Three checkboxes added to Setup sheet (B11-B13)
- Refactored `runAnalysis()` router to check all three boxes
- Executes selected analyses sequentially
- Each outputs to its own dedicated sheet

**Workflow**:
```
User checks: ‚òë Account  ‚òë Campaign  ‚òê Ad
Script runs: Account analysis ‚Üí Campaign analysis ‚Üí Done
Output sheets: DATA_Account_Output + DATA_Campaign_Output populated
```

**Impact**: Get comprehensive multi-level insights in one click

---

### 6. Three Output Sheets ‚úÖ
**What it does**: Separates data by analysis level for clean, focused datasets

**Implementation**:
- `DATA_Account_Output`: Account-wide metrics + demographics
- `DATA_Campaign_Output`: Campaign-specific metrics + demographics
- `DATA_Ad_Output`: Ad-level metrics + demographics
- Sheets auto-created if missing
- Each sheet cleared and repopulated on every run

**Benefits**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easier to connect to Looker Studio (each sheet = one data source)
- No data mixing or confusion
- Can run different analysis levels independently

**Impact**: Cleaner data structure, better analysis workflows

---

### 7. Enhanced Metrics ‚úÖ
**What it does**: Adds key performance indicators for reach optimization

**New Calculated Metrics**:
- **Period CPMr**: Cost per 1,000 users reached (vs. impressions)
- **Period CPA**: Cost per acquisition
- **Period ROAS**: Return on ad spend
- **28-Day Rolling Reach**: Unique users in rolling 28-day window
- **28-Day Rolling Incremental Reach**: New users in rolling window
- **28-Day CPMi**: Cost per incremental user in rolling window

**All metrics calculated**:
- Per time period (daily, 7-day, 28-day)
- For aggregated totals ("TOTAL" rows)
- For each demographic separately

**Impact**: More complete performance picture for reach-based optimization

## üìà Performance Considerations

### API Call Volume Increase
**V2.2**: 2 API calls per time period
- 1 for period metrics
- 1 for cumulative metrics

**V2.0 Standard**: 2 API calls per time period (same)
- Now include demographic breakdowns (no extra calls)

**V2.0 with 28-Day Rolling**: 4 API calls per date
- 1 for period metrics with demographics
- 1 for cumulative metrics with demographics
- 1 for 28-day rolling reach with demographics
- 1 for 28-day previous reach with demographics

**V2.0 Ad-Level**: 2 API calls per time period √ó number of ads
- Can be significant for accounts with many ads
- Recommend analyzing specific campaigns rather than all ads

### Processing Time Estimates
| Scenario | Time Period | V2.2 Time | V2.0 Time |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Account, 30 days daily | 30 periods | ~30 seconds | ~35 seconds |
| Campaign, 30 days daily | 30 periods | ~30 seconds | ~35 seconds |
| Account, 30 days rolling | 30 periods | N/A | ~75 seconds |
| Ad-level, 20 ads, 30 days | 600 periods | N/A | ~8-10 minutes |

*Times are estimates and vary by account size and network speed*
